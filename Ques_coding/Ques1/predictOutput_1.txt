Find the output for this code. Let input:- 2 3 6
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int x;
cout << "Enter first number\n";
cin >> x; // user will give ‘x’ a value.
int y, m;
cout << "Enter second number and value for taking modulus\n";
cin >> y >> m; // user will give ‘y’ a value.
int Z = (x * y) % m;
cout << "Output is: " << Z;
}

Ans:
 Output for this code should be: 
Enter first number:
2
Enter second number and value for taking modulus:
3 6
Output is: 0

Explanation:
In the memory of the computer, a 4 bytes place is created for int x and inside x, value 2 is placed.
In the memory of the computer, a 4 bytes place is created for int y and inside y, value 3 is placed.
In the memory of the computer, a 4 bytes place is created for int m and inside m, value 6 is placed.
In the memory of the computer, a 4 bytes place is created for int Z and inside Z, value (x * y) % m should be placed.
Calculating:(x * y) % m = (2 * 3) % 6 = 6 % 6 = 0
So, inside Z, 0 value will be placed.
