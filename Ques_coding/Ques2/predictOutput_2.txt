Find the output for this code. Let input:- 3 2
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int x;
cout<<"Enter first number\n";
cin>>x; // user will give 'x' a value.
int y;
cout<<"Enter second number\n";
cin>>y; // user will give 'y' a value.
cout<<(x!=y)<<" "<<(x>=y);
}

The output for this code should be:
Enter first number
3
Enter second number
2
1 1

Explanation:
In the memory of the computer, a 4 bytes place is created for int x and inside x, value 3 is placed.
In the memory of the computer, a 4 bytes place is created for int y and inside y, value 2 is placed.
Now, 2 conditions are there:
(x!=y) -> (3!=2) -> True -> prints 1
(x>=y) -> (3>=2) -> True -> prints 1
So, 1 1 is printed
