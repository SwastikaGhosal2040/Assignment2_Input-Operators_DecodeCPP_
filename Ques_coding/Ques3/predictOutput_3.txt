Find the output for this code. Let input:- 2 3

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int x,y;
cin>>x>>y;
x+=y;
x-=y;
x%=y;
cout<<x;
}


The output for this code should be:
2

Explanation:
In the memory of the computer, a 4 bytes place is created for int x and inside x, value 2 is placed.
In the memory of the computer, a 4 bytes place is created for int y and inside y, value 3 is placed.
Some arithmetic operations are there:
x+=y means x = x + y = 2 + 3 = 5
x-=y means x = x - y = 5 - 3 = 2
x%=y means x = x % y = 2 % 3 = 2
Now, x = 2
So, 2 is printed.
