Find the output of the below code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int i = ( 4 + 7 / 5 * 6 * 6+9 )% 100 ;
cout<<i;
}

Output of the code should be:
49

Explanation:
Order of precedence: () > / * > + -
In the expression
first the expression inside the () will be executed as it has highest precedence.
 / and * have same precedence and left to right associative, so first we should operate /, then *.
= (4 + 1 * 6 * 6 + 9) % 100
= (4 + 6 * 6 + 9) % 100
= (4 + 36 + 9) % 100
= 49 % 100
= 49
